# The Vision

For more than a decade the creation and use of Open Educational Resources (OER) has been increasing around the globe. The OER World Map collects and visualizes data on the growing number of actors and activities in the field of open education worldwide. The goal is to accelerate  the evolution of the global OER ecosystem by providing a comprehensive and responsive picture of the OER movement. The information provided can be used for a wide range of purposes, including:

- connecting actors with each other facilitating co-operation and sharing of resources and knowledge
- providing qualified lists of repositories and other OER services to help teachers and learners find educational resources relevant to them
- supporting policy makers in taking and defending strategic decisions by providing meaningful statistics and overviews of the open education movement and its associated impacts

The OER World Map is intended to provide the information needed to support the self-organization processes of the OER movement.  In addition to mapping relevant organisations, projects, people and services, the platform provides social networking, allows the identification of OER collections, and supports decision making. Taken together, the OER World Map can be seen as a kind of ‘operations room’ for the open education community.

The OER World Map is being built by [hbz](http://www.hbz-nrw.de) and [graphthinking GmbH](http://www.graphthinking.com) in association with [The Open University (UK)](http://www.open.ac.uk/) funded by [The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation](http://www.hewlett.org/). But it belongs to the global OER community. With input and intelligence from local sources and a global network of partners and volunteers, the OER World Map will be built and updated – a resource for all.
